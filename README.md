Implement P2P trading features for a crypto exchange on ICP. Allow users to create buy and sell offers for CKBTC, CKETH, CKSOL, BTC, ETH, ICP, GLDT, USDG, USDT, USD, GBP, EUR UAE,INR. Use a 2-of-3 multisig escrow system for all P2P trades, charging a 0.5% escrow fee on the trade amount. For the first 12 months after launch, do not charge the 0.15% trading fee for P2P trades; after 12 months, charge a 0.15% trading fee in addition to the escrow fee. Add direct crypto swaps using liquidity pools for pairs among listed assets, with 0.15% trading fee and 0.3% liquidity pool fee, always charged. Include credit card purchases at 2.5%, free deposits, and standard withdrawal fees (e.g., network fee plus small platform fee). Add lending/borrowing and exchange features, with tiered access for subscription accounts, including Broker Accounts facilitating trades for clients via sub-wallets.

Investment Management System:

Add an investment management system to track user investments across P2P finance features: P2P trading, swaps, credit card purchases, lending/borrowing, withdrawals/deposits, liquidity pools, exchanges. Track performance (e.g., ROI), returns (e.g., profits), and risk (e.g., volatility), storing data in canisters for scalability. Ensure Founder, Admin, Developer accounts have full access, while subscription accounts (Broker, High Value Listings/Volume Trade, P2P High Value Listings/Volume Lending, Lending Brokers, P2P High Value Listings/Volume) have tiered access based on their tier ($0–$10,000, $0–$24,999, $0–$99,999), with higher tiers unlocking advanced tools like portfolio optimization. For Broker Accounts, track investments for primary wallets and sub-wallets, ensuring client-specific analytics.
