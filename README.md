Recent X posts, like one from @OG_CryptoPapi, compare it to ChatGPT on steroids, and @icphub_ID noted its announcement at #WCS25, suggesting early access applications. This aligns with the Internet Computer Roadmap 2025 Update, which highlights Caffeine AI as a key feature for prompt-based app creation.

There are concerns about its readiness for complex financial applications, especially broker management systems so developer will be needed here for more detailed features.

Advanced features like multi-client wallet management, analytics, and accountancy, additional customization might be needed. While Caffeine AI can handle basic structures, i  may need to refine generated code for features like multisig escrow, governance systems, and detailed analytics, especially given the complexity of tracking and displaying data for brokers and their clients.

ICP offers scalable, low-cost, and tamperproof infrastructure, making it ideal for a P2P exchange with a broker management system. Given my requirements, Caffeine AI can be instructed to build the exchange by providing detailed prompts for each stage, ensuring that features like trading/swaps, P2P trades, subscription payments, and broker management are implemented securely and efficiently, with universal analytics and referral tracking.

For Broker Accounts, suggest fees: $10/month for Tier 1 ($0–$10,000), $25/month for Tier 2 ($0–$24,999), $50/month for Tier 3 ($0–$99,999), covering wallet management, analytics, accountancy, and Decide AI verification.
Ensure secure payment processing via ICP tokens, stable-coins like USDG, USDT, or credit cards, with automated renewal and tier adjustment based on activity, as seen in ICP Payment Solutions.

Investment Management and Analytics with Decide AI

The investment management system will track user investments across P2P finance features:
P2P trading, swaps, credit card purchases, lending/borrowing, withdrawals/deposits, liquidity pools, exchanges.
Track performance (e.g., ROI), returns (e.g., profits), and risk (e.g., volatility), with tiered access for subscription accounts, including Broker Accounts for clients, enhanced by Decide AI for compliance.
The analytics system will display data for all P2P finance features, coin types (CKBTC, CKETH, CKSOL, BTC, ETH, ICP, SOL, GLDT, USDG, USDT, USD, GBP, EUR, UAE, INR), new token listings, and advertising space, in pie charts, bar charts, and itemized text, with tiered access ensuring Founder, Admin, Developer see all, and subscription accounts see data based on tier, integrated with Decide AI for verified data.

Referral Analytics Section with Decide AI

Include a referral section on all account profiles, showing analytics for referred customers:
Itemized totals (earnings per referred user), total refers, and statistics (volume, fees, activity levels, engagement metrics), enhanced by Decide AI for verified referral identities.
Display in pie charts, bar charts, and itemized text, with tiered access ensuring Founder, Admin, Developer see all, Standard accounts see basic data, and subscription accounts see detailed data based on tier, integrated with Decide AI for compliance.

These features will integrate with Decide AI, ensuring a cohesive platform.
